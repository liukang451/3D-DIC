# Multi-DIC Project
The objective of this project is to extend the Python code from two dimensional deformation measurement to three dimensional derformation measurement.Our project was supposed to perform the same functionality as that of given MATLAB code. 

## Set up
First run `python3 -m venv venv`  to create a virtual environment.

Then run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages into the virtual environment.

## Using by a program



## Using by command line
For each step, a helpful script is included in .py format. To run the code, open the command line interface and type in the command to run the code. For an instance for step-1, type in the command like "python step1.py". then the interface will ask you for step by step working of the code.
