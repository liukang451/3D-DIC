# Multi-DIC Project
The objective of this project is to extend the Python code from two dimensional deformation measurement to three dimensional derformation measurement.

## Set up
First run `python3 -m venv venv`  to create a virtual environment.

Then run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages into the virtual environment.
